# factorial-digits
<p1>This program calculates the factorial (n!) of a user input and then calculates the sum of the parsed factorial's digits.</p1><br><br>
<p2>The description of the program is as follow:</p2><br>
<ol>
  <li>The user can enter any integer value</li>
  <li>The factorial of the integer which the user entered is calculated. Since a factorial of a number can have a large result, the result of each individual multiplication is stored in an array.</li>
  <li>As the results are stored in this factorial array, a summation of the new addad array index is done every time a new multiplication value is added to the factorial array.</li>
  <li>The result is then printed on the command line.</li>
</ol>
